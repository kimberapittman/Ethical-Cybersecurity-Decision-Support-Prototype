scenarios:
  Baltimore Ransomware Attack:
    constraints:
      - Outdated IT infrastructure (insufficient segmentation, poor patch management)
      - Fragmented authority delayed coordination
      - No incident-specific continuity plan
      - Funding limitations and ignored prior vulnerability warnings

  San Diego Smart Streetlights and Surveillance:
    constraints:
      - Procurement under general contracts without clear surveillance labeling
      - Fragmented governance: no single entity responsible for oversight
      - Governance “black hole” allowed SDPD use without institutional checks
      - Funding via energy-efficiency bonds and vendor partnerships obscured scope and limited council oversight

  Riverton AI-Enabled Threat:
    constraints:
      - Vendor contracts lacked audit rights for AI code/training data
      - Split authority between IT, utilities board, and mayor’s office, with no dispute resolution protocol
      - Procurement prioritized cost savings and speed over ethical/security vetting
