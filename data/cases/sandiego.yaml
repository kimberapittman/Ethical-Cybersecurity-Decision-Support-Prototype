background:
  technical_operational_background: >
    In 2016, the San Diego City Council approved a smart streetlight initiative framed as an
    energy-efficiency and urban-analytics program.23 The initiative retrofitted thousands of
    streetlights with energy-efficient LEDs integrated with cameras and sensor-equipped units
    capable of collecting environmental and mobility data.24 The smart network’s sensors were
    designed to cover roughly half of the city, creating a wide geographic footprint for data
    collection.25 The system operated through a vendor-supported platform in which the vendor
    owned the processed data while city agencies were provided access to the underlying data.26
    Day-to-day management of the platform involved coordination across municipal departments
    and external vendors, particularly for data integration and maintenance support.27 Taken
    together, these operational features formed the technological environment in which later
    concerns arose regarding municipal access to system footage.

  triggering_condition_key_events: >
    Beginning in 2018, the San Diego Police Department began requesting and using footage from
    the smart streetlight cameras to support criminal investigations, despite the program
    having been implemented for energy-efficiency and urban-analytics purposes.28 Over time,
    the number of access requests increased, and by 2019 footage was being used in a range of
    cases, including investigations of violent crimes and vandalism and looting during
    protests.29 Public awareness of SDPD’s use of the system expanded in 2019 after media
    reporting highlighted the scale of law-enforcement access, prompting questions about how
    the data was being governed and under what authority departments could retrieve footage.30
    These developments drew attention to how the system’s data was being accessed and governed,
    creating the operational conditions within which municipal staff would later assess
    whether existing access practices aligned with the program’s established scope and
    governance structures.

technical:
  decision_context: >
    The onset of expanded law-enforcement access to smart streetlight footage created a
    decision context in which system administrators and relevant municipal staff had to
    determine how the platform’s access configurations should be managed once it became clear
    that the system was being used for purposes beyond its originally documented scope. Because
    the platform did not operate under a fully articulated governance structure specifying
    when and how video data could be retrieved, staff were required to assess whether existing
    permissions should remain in place or whether adjustments were necessary while questions
    about appropriate use were being addressed through administrative channels.

      rationale: >
        This decision context aligns with the Protect function of the NIST CSF because the
        operational task involved evaluating how access rights to the platform should be
        configured in the absence of defined governance procedures. Framing the situation
        through the Protect function clarifies that the central operational question involved
        determining what access posture was defensible while the scope and authority of data
        retrieval practices were under review. This procedural framing defined the boundaries
        within which staff assessed whether to maintain existing permissions or modify them
        pending further clarification.

ethical:
  pfce_analysis: >
    Viewed through the PFCE, the decision context introduced ethical tension once it became
    clear that smart streetlight footage was being accessed through pathways not explicitly
    articulated in the program’s publicly documented governance policies. Within this context,
    beneficence was implicated insofar as access to footage could support investigative efforts
    that advance public safety, while autonomy was simultaneously implicated because residents
    had not been provided clear information about the circumstances under which video data
    might be retrieved for purposes beyond the system’s original energy- and
    analytics-oriented framing. Justice became relevant because ambiguities in access
    procedures can shape how different communities experience or perceive the governance of
    municipal data systems, particularly when surveillance-adjacent technologies are involved.
    Explicability was salient because staff required a clearer understanding of how access
    requests were made, what authority supported them, and what oversight mechanisms existed
    to ensure appropriate use. Taken together, these obligations clarify the ethical
    significance of the situation before any operational decision regarding future access
    configurations was made.

        Maintaining access to system footage to support investigative and public-safety

constraints:
  - type: "Program design limitations"
    description: >
      The initiative was designed as an energy-efficiency and urban-analytics program and did
      not anticipate law-enforcement use, creating gaps in documentation and oversight once
      access requests expanded.31
    effect_on_decision: >
      Practitioners lacked clearly defined governance procedures when evaluating whether
      existing access practices aligned with the program’s scope.

  - type: "Absence of surveillance policy"
    description: >
      The city had not adopted a formal surveillance policy specifying when and under what
      authority law-enforcement access to smart streetlight footage could occur.32
    effect_on_decision: >
      Practitioners lacked procedural guardrails when assessing whether to maintain or modify
      access configurations.

  - type: "Lack of cross-departmental review process"
    description: >
      The city lacked a cross-departmental process for evaluating secondary uses of municipal
      data systems.33
    effect_on_decision: >
      This governance gap complicated efforts to determine whether interim technical
      restrictions were appropriate while policy guidance was being developed.

  - type: "Distributed operational responsibility"
    description: >
      Operational responsibility for the system was distributed across multiple departments
      and vendor partners.34
    effect_on_decision: >
      This limited the city’s ability to form a unified understanding of how footage was
      stored, retained, and accessed.

  - type: "Funding and procurement arrangements"
    description: >
      Much of the infrastructure was financed through energy-efficiency bonds and vendor
      agreements, reducing awareness among city council members and community stakeholders
      regarding the system’s surveillance capabilities.35
    effect_on_decision: >
      These arrangements shaped governance capacity and constrained how quickly oversight
      mechanisms could be clarified.

decision_outcome:
  decision: >
    San Diego suspended new installations of the smart streetlight system and implemented a
    temporary halt to law-enforcement access while the city conducted a broader review of
    governance policies and data-management practices.36

  outcomes_implications: >
    Suspending access and installations introduced immediate constraints on investigative
    workflows and urban-analytics activities, while the development of new governance
    structures reshaped expectations for how municipal data systems should be evaluated and
    managed. The moratorium and subsequent policy reforms also influenced public trust, as
    residents and community groups assessed how the city responded to concerns about
    undocumented access pathways. Taken together, these developments carried implications for
    institutional legitimacy by clarifying where prior governance gaps had existed and how the
    city intended to oversee data-generating technologies moving forward.

      Suspending access constrained investigative and analytical workflows while governance
