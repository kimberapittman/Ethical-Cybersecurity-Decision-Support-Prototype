title: "CASE 1: BALTIMORE – WHEN PROTECTING SYSTEMS MEETS PROTECTING THE PUBLIC"

short_summary: >
  The Baltimore ransomware attack presents a case in which municipal cybersecurity practitioners
  confronted a decision with immediate consequences for service continuity across the city. The
  decision examined in this case centers on whether to disconnect additional municipal systems to
  limit further spread of the ransomware while the scope of the compromise remained unclear.

background:
  technical_operational_background: >
    In 2019, the City of Baltimore operated a distributed municipal IT environment supporting
    essential administrative and public-service functions across multiple departments.2 The
    city’s technology systems operated on a wide variety of systems and aging infrastructure
    and was described in city documents as requiring ongoing modernization efforts.3 The city
    also faced documented cybersecurity capability and staffing challenges, as the city’s Chief
    Information Officer reported that Baltimore was “woefully behind in cybersecurity
    capabilities, staff needs and infrastructure”.4 In the years prior, external assessments
    had described Baltimore’s aging technology environment as presenting elevated exposure to
    cyber threats.5 Earlier cyber incidents, including a 2018 intrusion into Baltimore’s 911
    and 311 systems caused by a firewall being temporarily disabled during maintenance,
    highlighted procedural vulnerabilities in system configuration and change-management
    processes.6 Taken together, these operational conditions formed the technological backdrop
    against which Baltimore confronted the 2019 RobbinHood ransomware attack.

  triggering_condition_key_events: >
    In May 2019, multiple municipal systems in Baltimore abruptly became inaccessible after
    RobbinHood ransomware was deployed across portions of the city’s network.7 The malware
    encrypted files on affected servers and displayed a ransom note demanding payment in
    cryptocurrency, reportedly equivalent to approximately 13 Bitcoin (about $76,280).8 City
    employees attempting to access departmental applications encountered locked systems, and
    services began to fail across email, phone lines, and online payment platforms.9 Because
    the city did not maintain continuous cybersecurity monitoring, it took several hours for
    officials to identify the scope of the incident once systems began failing.10 Once IT staff
    identified that the attack had affected servers supporting key administrative functions, an
    internal shutdown of additional systems was initiated to prevent further spread.11 As
    systems were taken offline, nearly every department experienced disruptions: employees lost
    access to email; online payment services for water bills, property taxes, and traffic
    citations were disabled; and non-emergency police communications systems were temporarily
    knocked offline.12 Real-estate transactions were also affected as title companies could not
    obtain lien certificates required to complete property sales.13 Over the following days,
    departments reported continued service interruptions while technical teams worked to assess
    the extent of the compromise.

technical:
  decision_context: >
    The onset of the ransomware attack created a decision context in which Baltimore’s
    cybersecurity practitioners had to determine whether to maintain system connectivity while
    assessing the scope of the compromise or disconnect additional systems to prevent further
    spread. Because multiple municipal systems had already become encrypted and inaccessible,
    practitioners faced a decision about whether leaving unaffected systems online introduced
    continued risk or whether additional isolation would better limit potential propagation.

      rationale: >
        This decision aligns with the Respond function of the NIST CSF because practitioners
        had to decide between preserving service continuity or implementing containment
        measures. Framing the situation through the Respond function clarifies that the
        operational task at this stage involved determining whether additional isolation was
        necessary to limit potential impact while system recovery remained ongoing. This
        decision context defined the procedural boundaries within which practitioners assessed
        their response options.

ethical:
  pfce_analysis: >
    Viewed through the PFCE, the decision context itself introduced ethical tension, as
    disconnecting additional systems to contain the ransomware risk meant reducing or
    suspending access to municipal services that residents and departments relied on for daily
    operations. Within this context, the potential containment action placed beneficence and
    non-maleficence into direct tension, as efforts to prevent further ransomware spread
    introduced concurrent risks of disrupting essential services. Autonomy was implicated
    because departmental staff temporarily lost the ability to access or manage their systems.
    Justice was implicated because service interruptions in areas such as payment processing
    and administrative functions had uneven effects on residents and businesses depending on
    their reliance on timely municipal services. Explicability was implicated because limited
    information about the ransomware’s propagation path constrained practitioners’ ability to
    determine whether further isolation was necessary or overly precautionary. Taken together,
    these obligations clarify the ethical significance of the situation before any specific
    operational course of action was selected.

constraints:
  - type: "Organizational transition"
    description: >
      At the time of the attack, the city was in the early stages of a transition toward
      centralized technology functions.14
    effect_on_decision: >
      This shaped how practitioners understood the incident and the options available to them
      at the time containment decisions had to be made.

  - type: "Decentralized IT structure"
    description: >
      IT operations were organized under a decentralized structure, with system administration
      responsibilities distributed across multiple departments.14
    effect_on_decision: >
      This limited the ability to form a unified operational picture of system interdependencies
      during the early response.

  - type: "Staffing and resource limitations"
    description: >
      The city faced documented staffing and resource limitations, as officials acknowledged
      that constrained personnel and funding affected Baltimore’s overall cybersecurity
      capacity at the time of the incident.15
    effect_on_decision: >
      These limitations shaped how practitioners assessed the situation and which containment
      actions were realistically feasible.

  - type: "Lack of incident-specific continuity plan"
    description: >
      The city did not have a formalized incident-specific continuity plan, resulting in
      departments relying on ad-hoc workarounds during early recovery efforts.16
    effect_on_decision: >
      This limited the predictability of any containment strategy under consideration.

decision_outcome:
  decision: >
    The containment decision ultimately taken involved disconnecting additional systems as a
    precautionary measure while the scope of the ransomware deployment was still being
    assessed.17

  outcomes_implications: >
    The operational consequences of the containment decision had uneven effects across
    municipal services and the residents who relied on them, illustrating how wide-ranging
    disruptions—to internal communication, billing functions, property transactions, and other
    routine services—carry implications beyond their immediate administrative impact. These
    accumulated effects created practical burdens for departments and residents who depended
    on timely access to city systems, and their uneven distribution underscored longstanding
    questions about equity in service availability during municipal disruptions. The scale and
    duration of these disruptions also influenced public trust, as residents and businesses
    assessed the city’s ability to maintain essential functions under cyberattack conditions.
    Taken together, these impacts carried implications for institutional legitimacy by
    revealing how fragile or fragmented system dependencies can affect perceptions of
    municipal reliability during a crisis.
