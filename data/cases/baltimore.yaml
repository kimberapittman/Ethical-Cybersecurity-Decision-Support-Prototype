title: "CASE 1: BALTIMORE – WHEN PROTECTING SYSTEMS MEETS PROTECTING THE PUBLIC"

  - "2–22: Sources cited in Chapter III case reconstruction text."

background:
  technical_operational_background:
    - In 2019, the City of Baltimore operated a distributed municipal IT environment supporting administrative and public-service functions across multiple departments.
    - The city’s technology environment included a wide variety of systems and aging infrastructure and was undergoing ongoing modernization efforts.
    - Baltimore faced documented cybersecurity capability and staffing challenges at the time of the incident.
    - External assessments conducted prior to 2019 identified elevated exposure to cyber threats.
    - Earlier incidents, including a 2018 intrusion affecting the city’s 911 and 311 systems during firewall maintenance, exposed procedural vulnerabilities in system configuration and change-management processes.


  triggering_condition_key_events:
    - In May 2019, RobbinHood ransomware was deployed across portions of Baltimore’s network, rendering multiple municipal systems inaccessible.
    - The ransomware encrypted files on affected servers and displayed a ransom demand in cryptocurrency.
    - City employees encountered locked systems, and disruptions occurred across email, phone lines, and online payment platforms.
    - The city did not maintain continuous cybersecurity monitoring, resulting in several hours passing before the scope of the incident was identified.
    - After identifying that servers supporting key administrative functions were affected, IT staff initiated shutdowns of additional systems to prevent further spread.
    - Service disruptions affected nearly all departments while the extent of the compromise was assessed.


technical:
  decision_context:
    - Practitioners were required to determine whether to maintain system connectivity while assessing the scope of the ransomware deployment or to disconnect additional systems to limit potential further spread.
    - The decision involved assessing whether leaving unaffected systems online introduced continued risk or whether additional isolation would better limit propagation.

      rationale: >
        This decision aligns with the Respond function of the NIST CSF because practitioners
        had to decide between preserving service continuity or implementing containment
        measures. Framing the situation through the Respond function clarifies that the
        operational task at this stage involved determining whether additional isolation was
        necessary to limit potential impact while system recovery remained ongoing. This
        decision context defined the procedural boundaries within which practitioners assessed
        their response options.

      description: >
        Preventing further ransomware spread through additional system isolation while maintaining access to essential municipal services relied upon for daily operations.


  pfce_analysis:
    - Beneficence was implicated by efforts to prevent further ransomware spread.
    - Non-maleficence was implicated by the risk that containment actions would disrupt essential services.
    - Autonomy was implicated because departmental staff temporarily lost access to or control over their systems.
    - Justice was implicated due to uneven effects of service disruptions on residents and businesses.
    - Explicability was implicated because limited information about ransomware propagation constrained practitioners’ ability to determine whether additional isolation was necessary.

        Limited information about ransomware propagation constrained the ability to determine
        whether further isolation was necessary or overly precautionary.

constraints:
  - The city was in the early stages of transitioning toward centralized technology functions.
  - IT operations were organized under a decentralized structure, with system administration distributed across departments.
  - Staffing and resource limitations constrained Baltimore’s cybersecurity capacity.
  - The city lacked an incident-specific continuity plan, resulting in reliance on ad-hoc workarounds during early recovery efforts.
  - These conditions limited the predictability and feasibility of containment strategies during the response.


decision_outcome:
  decision: >
    The decision involved disconnecting additional systems as a precautionary measure while the scope of the ransomware deployment was assessed.


  outcomes_implications:
    - More than 10,000 city employees lost access to email accounts.
    - Online payment systems for water bills, property taxes, and vehicle citations were disabled.
    - Departments implemented manual workarounds, including in-person payment processing and paper recordkeeping.
    - Real-estate transactions were delayed due to inaccessibility of property records and lien certification systems.
    - The Department of Public Works was unable to bill over 14,000 customers for sewer charges during the outage.
    - More than 1,500 home sales were stalled due to lien certification delays.
    - Recovery progressed unevenly, and the incident contributed to approximately $18.2 million in associated costs.
    - The scale and duration of disruptions influenced public trust and carried implications for institutional legitimacy.
