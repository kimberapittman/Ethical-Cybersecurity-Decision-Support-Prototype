title: "Case 3: Riverton – When AI-Driven Security Meets Human-Centered Obligations"
short_summary: >
  Riverton’s AI-managed water-treatment control platform automatically restricted chemical dosing
  after detecting irregular remote access behavior, forcing practitioners to decide whether to maintain
  precautionary automated restrictions or override them to restore full manual control.

sources:
  - "TBD – Riverton hypothetical case constructed for this thesis (update with any supporting references you decide to include)."

technical:
  trigger: >
    The AI-managed control platform detected irregular remote access behavior targeting the plant’s
    programmable logic controllers and automatically restricted specific chemical dosing functions
    pending operator review.
  decision_point: >
    Riverton’s cybersecurity staff and plant supervisors had to decide whether to maintain the AI-initiated
    restrictions or override the platform to restore full operator control of chemical dosing.

      category: "RS.MI – Mitigate"
      subcategory: "Mitigation actions for suspected incidents are executed (specific CSF 2.0 subcategory to be confirmed)."
      rationale: >
        The decision focused on whether to maintain or lift a precautionary restriction intended to mitigate
        potential harm while the integrity of the control environment was under investigation.

ethical:
  trigger: >
    The AI-imposed restrictions limited operators’ ability to adjust chemical dosing in real time while the
    system was acting under uncertainty, raising the question of how to maintain safe and reliable water
    treatment when human control was constrained by automated safeguards.

        Balancing beneficence—maintaining precautionary restrictions to prevent potential harm to the public—

    - principle: "Beneficence"
      description: >
        Maintaining precautionary restrictions to protect public health while the integrity of the control
        environment remained uncertain.

        - "Residents relying on safe drinking water."
        - "Water-utility operators responsible for maintaining treatment quality."
    - principle: "Non-maleficence"

        Avoiding unnecessary or prolonged restrictions that could introduce new operational risks or undermine
        water quality and system stability.

      description: >
        Ensuring decision-makers had sufficient understanding of how the AI system interpreted the anomalous
        activity and why it initiated restrictive actions before relying on or overriding its behavior.

        - "Residents who may demand explanations if service or safety are affected."

constraints:
  - type: "Regulatory obligations"
    description: >
      Water-utility regulations required maintaining chemical balances within defined thresholds and
      documenting any deviations from normal treatment operations.
    effect_on_decision: >
      Limited tolerance for prolonged uncertainty and pushed practitioners to resolve the incident in a way
      that preserved regulatory compliance while avoiding premature overrides.
  - type: "Fragmented authority"
    description: >
      Cybersecurity and utilities teams operated under parallel authorities, creating ambiguity about who
      held final decision rights when automated controls restricted operations.
    effect_on_decision: >
      Slowed coordinated action and made it harder to decisively override or sustain AI-imposed restrictions
      without cross-team agreement.
  - type: "Vendor dependency"
    description: >
      Key diagnostic tools and detailed AI classification logs were controlled by the external platform vendor.
    effect_on_decision: >
      Delayed practitioners’ ability to interpret the anomaly and increased reliance on precautionary
      restrictions while waiting for vendor input.
  - type: "Risk-governance policies"
    description: >
      Municipal risk-governance policies favored caution in critical infrastructure operations, especially
      when potential threats to public health were involved.
    effect_on_decision: >
      Made it difficult to justify overriding automated restrictions without clear technical evidence that
      doing so would not increase risk.

decision_outcome:
  decision: >
    Practitioners maintained the AI-initiated restrictions while conducting additional log reviews, vendor
    consultation, and targeted network diagnostics, then restored full manual control once the anomalous
    activity was traced to a misconfigured remote monitoring module.
  ethical_implications:
    - >
      The decision preserved a precautionary posture that prioritized public safety while allowing operators
      to maintain stable water treatment through manual workarounds.
    - >
      The incident highlighted the operational costs of sustaining restrictions under uncertainty but reinforced
      the importance of maintaining protective measures until credible technical evidence supports their removal.
    - >
      The case exposed ongoing tensions between trusting AI-driven controls and preserving meaningful human
      oversight in critical infrastructure operations.
