- **Purpose:** Support municipal cybersecurity practitioners in navigating complex ethical dilemmas. This tool guides users through high-stakes decisions in real time‚Äîaligning actions with technical standards, clarifying value conflicts, and documenting justifiable outcomes under institutional and governance constraints.  
- **Backbone:** This prototype draws on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, guiding users through six core functions: **Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover**. These are integrated with Principlist ethical values‚Äî**Beneficence, Non-maleficence, Autonomy, Justice, Explicability**‚Äîto help users weigh trade-offs and make morally defensible decisions.  
- **Context:** Designed specifically for municipal use, the prototype accounts for real-world constraints like limited budgets, fragmented authority, and vendor opacity. It supports ethical decision-making within these practical and political realities.
