These are integrated with Principlist ethical values: Beneficence, Non-maleficence, Autonomy, Justice, and Explicability - to help ussers weigh trade-offs and make morally  defensible decisions.

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** is a risk-based framework created by the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology to help organizations manage and reduce 
cybersecurity risks. It is organized into six core functions, which together provide a 
comprehensive approach to managing cyber risk:

- **Govern (GV):** Establish and communicate organizational context, roles, policies, and oversight for managing cybersecurity risk.  
- **Identify (ID):** Develop an organizational understanding of systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities to manage risk.  
- **Protect (PR):** Develop and implement safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.  
- **Detect (DE):** Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.  
- **Respond (RS):** Take appropriate action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.  
- **Recover (RC):** Maintain plans for resilience and restore capabilities impaired by incidents.  

In this prototype, the CSF provides the **technical backbone**.  
Relevant CSF functions are highlighted for each scenario, and notes explain how they 
apply in that specific situation‚Äîensuring that ethical reasoning (via the Principlist 
Framework) is grounded in recognized technical standards.

The **Principlist Framework for Cybersecurity Ethics** is a practical approach to ethical

organized into five core principles, which together provide a comprehensive approach 
to identifying, weighing, and justifying ethical trade-offs:

- **Beneficence:** Promote public well-being and the delivery of essential services.  
- **Non-maleficence:** Avoid foreseeable harm from actions taken or omitted (e.g., over-collection, rash shutdowns).  
- **Autonomy:** Respect legal rights, due process, and meaningful choice for affected people.  
- **Justice:** Distribute burdens and benefits fairly; avoid disproportionate impact on specific communities.  
- **Explicability:** Ensure transparency, accountability, and the ability to explain decisions and system behavior.  

In this prototype, the Principlist Framework provides the **ethical backbone**.  
Relevant principles are highlighted for each scenario, making value tensions explicit
