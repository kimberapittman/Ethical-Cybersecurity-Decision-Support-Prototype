- **Purpose:** Support municipal cybersecurity practitioners in navigating complex ethical dilemmas. The tool is designed to guide users through high-stakes decisions in real time—clarifying value conflicts, aligning actions with technical standards, and documenting justifiable outcomes under institutional and governance constraints.
- **Backbone:** The tool draws on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, guiding users through six core functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These are integrated with principlist ethical values—Beneficence, Non-maleficence, Autonomy, Justice, and Explicability—to help users weigh trade-offs and make morally defensible decisions.
- **Context:** Designed specifically for municipal use, the tool accounts for real-world constraints like limited budgets, outdated systems, fragmented authority, and opaque procurement. It supports ethical decision-making within these practical and political realities.

**How this prototype applies it:** Based on the chosen scenario, the app highlights the CSF functions most
implicated by the facts. In **Thesis scenarios** mode (read‑only), these functions are shown as fixed “chips”
to reflect the technical posture the municipality should consider; in **Open‑ended** mode, you can adjust them.
