When law enforcement began using the sensors for surveillance without clear public oversight, ethical concerns about transparency, consent, and mission creep arose.",
    "Hypothetical Workforce Monitoring Case": "A fictional city IT department considers deploying AI-based monitoring software on employee devices to detect insider threats. Ethical tensions arise around privacy, informed consent, and balancing security with employee rights."

### About the Prototype
This prototype demonstrates how a decision-support tool could guide municipal cybersecurity practitioners through ethically and technically complex scenarios. It is not intended to prescribe answers but to illuminate value tensions, relevant standards, and contextual constraints using structured, real-world case reconstructions. Each scenario is drawn from thesis case studies and showcases how ethical reasoning and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework can inform decision-making in high-stakes environments.
