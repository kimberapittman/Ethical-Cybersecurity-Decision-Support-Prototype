- **Backbone:** This prototype draws on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, guiding users through six core functions: **Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover**. These are integrated with Principlist ethical values—**Beneficence, Non-maleficence, Autonomy, Justice, Explicability**—to help users weigh trade-offs and make morally defensible decisions.  
- **Context:** Designed specifically for municipal use, the prototype accounts for real-world constraints like limited budgets, fragmented authority, and vendor opacity. It supports ethical decision-making within these practical and political realities.

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** is a risk-based framework created by the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology to help organizations manage and reduce 
cybersecurity risks. It is organized into six core functions:

- **Govern (GV):** Establish and communicate organizational context, roles, policies, and oversight for managing cybersecurity risk.  
- **Identify (ID):** Develop an organizational understanding of systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities to manage risk.  
- **Protect (PR):** Develop and implement safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.  
- **Detect (DE):** Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.  
- **Respond (RS):** Take appropriate action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.  
- **Recover (RC):** Maintain plans for resilience and restore capabilities impaired by incidents.  

In this prototype, the CSF provides the **technical backbone**, and the Principlist Framework provides the **ethical backbone**.
