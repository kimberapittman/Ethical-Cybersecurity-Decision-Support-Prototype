# ---- ABOUT THE PROTOTYPE ----
st.markdown("""
This interactive tool is designed to demonstrate how ethical and technical frameworks can guide decision-making in complex municipal cybersecurity scenarios. The goal is to show how structured ethical reasoning can work alongside technical standards to navigate trade-offs, justify decisions, and document rationale. It is built around three illustrative case studies used in a thesis project.

    - **Frameworks Used**:
        - [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework): A widely adopted technical risk management standard.

    - **Design Goal**: Provide structured guidance without prescribing outcomes. The tool surfaces ethical tensions and institutional constraints to help users reach morally defensible, context-aware decisions.
